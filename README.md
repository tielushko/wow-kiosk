# University of South Florida Week of Welcome

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Introduction

In the beginning of every semester University of South Florida holds an event called Week of Welcome which is meant to introduce new students to USF and help facilitate a successful start of the semester to returning students. Its main goal is to get the students involved in the events across campus and get helpful resources from the volunteers regarding college campus and activities. The main stakeholder, Microsoft, desires to assist USF community in building a virtual kiosk for such an event that can facilitate remote interaction between students and volunteers, as well as offer help through the usage of a chatbot. There is a problem of getting the best resources during the Week of Welcome especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic and having a remote kiosk with the voice and video enabled communication, and bot assistant will offer the students plenty of informational resources and help. 

This repository represents the main web applicatioin and is hosted on https://wow-kiosk.netlify.app/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Allows you to pull all the required node_modules to your local repository

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
